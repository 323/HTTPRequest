h2. Welcome to the home of HTTPRequest, a simple Java HTTPWrapper

Keep in mind, this code is open source and can be modified and distributed freely.

h3. What is HTTPRequest

HTTPRequest.java is a simple HTTP Wrapper that allows both HTTP get and post requests in Java as well as user specification of headers and cookies.

h3. Using HTTPRequest

The use of HTTPRequest is pretty straightforward.

The following should shed some light on the different functionalities of these classes, however the Tester.java class should also provide some examples of functon usage.

h3. Creating an Object

@HTTPRequest request = new HTTPRequest();@

Creates a simple request object. This can alos be done wtih a String type argument of the URL.

h3. Specifying a URL

As stated before this can be done in the object instantiation or by using the function @setURL@ as follows:

@reqest.setURL("http://google.com/");@

The URL can also be retrieved using @getURL@.

h3. Setting Headers

There are a number of functions for setting headers. These headers will apply to both post and get requests.

@setUserAgent(String userAgent)@
@setAccept(String type, String language, String charset)@
@setKeepAlive(String keepAlive)@
@setConnection(String connection)@
@setReferer(String referer)@
@setContent(String type, String length, Sting language)@

Every one of these functions has its own "getter" method which returns the variable associated with it.

h3. Cookies

A cookie object is created at initialization and can be accessed outside the Wrapper using the variable name @myCookie@.

Cookie creation comes with tis own seperate class, Cookie.java.
This class stores cookies in an ArrayList and contains the following functions.

@getCookie(String cookie)@
@setCookies(String theCookies)@
@getCookies()@
@updateCookies(URLConnection theConnection)@
@removeCookie(String cookie)@
@clearCookies()@
